        <h3>Network Speed Test (NDT)</h3>
        <p>
            Our app includes a Speed Test feature powered by the Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) protocol provided by
            <strong>Measurement Lab (M-Lab)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>When you initiate a speed test, certain data is collected and transmitted to M-Lab's servers, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your IP Address</li>
            <li>Network performance metrics (Download/Upload speeds, latency, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> M-Lab is an open-source research project. In order to support global internet
        research, M-Lab publishes all test results, including your IP address, in their public database for open access.
        By using the speed test feature, you consent to the collection and public release of this data.
